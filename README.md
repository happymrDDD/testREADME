# Declaration
There are 2 project in the ZIP package, one is TWhomework --- the main code for problem One ,a
and another one is a simple Junit test case to vaildate the method of 
TWHomework named TWHomeworkTest. </br><br>

I did not use any build tools,So it's better for you to import the source code
into IDE to test, below is the configuration on my laptop: </br>

* Langauge: JAVA (version 1.8.0_144)
* Library : JavaSE-1.8 , JUnit 4
* IDE : eclipse
 
***
# Steps
Please follow below to import the code into IDE:</br>
1. Create 2 new java project named TWHomework and TWHomeworkTest in your IDE     
2. Copy the source code to override the src file for those 2 project created in step1   
3. Add TWHomework as required project and JUnit 4 Library to the TWHomeworkTest build path  
4. Run the Class MAIN under the pers.ddd.twhomework in project TWHomework, you can see the output of Problem 1    
5. Run the Class ResultServiceTest in project TWHomeworkTest , you can see the JUnit test result
